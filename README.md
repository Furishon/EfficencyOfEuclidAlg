# Efficency of the Euclidian Algorithm
Investigating the efficiency of the Euclidean algorithm for finding gcd(a, b), as a function of integers a & b.


## The Euclidean Algorithm
The algorithm is a method for finding the gcd of two integers a & b. It works as follows:

Let r<sub>0</sub>  = a and r<sub>1</sub> = b. 

Then r<sub>2</sub> = r<sub>0</sub> % r<sub>1</sub>
  
r<sub>3</sub> = r<sub>1</sub> % r<sub>2</sub>

...

r<sub>n</sub> = r<sub>n-2</sub> % r<sub>n-1</sub>

r<sub>n+1</sub> = r<sub>n-1</sub> % r<sub>n</sub>, where r<sub>n+1</sub> = 0.

It turns out that r<sub>n</sub> = gcd(a, b).
  
  
## Evaluating efficency
This package evaluates the efficency by plotting the number of iterations required by the algorithm (the value of n+1) as a function of both a & b as a heatmap. The range of a & b is between 0 and a user-defined value.

An example heatmap for 0 <= a, b <= 5000 can be seen in heatmap.png. 


## Usage
To evaluate all pairs (a, b) for 0 <= a, b <= n, call `python3 plot.py n`.
